Hello viewer!
If you're here to make your own tracker, do keep in mind that you need your own keys from an API of your choice (I used Pubnub).
You can also use whatever map application you'd like, but I used good ol' 
Hardware-wise, you're gonna need a raspberry pi 3, 4, or zero (I used a zero because it was more compact and easier to fit in small areas) and a GPS module.

note: you do not need to publish your website in order for this to work, and idk why you'd want random people on the internet to see where you live
